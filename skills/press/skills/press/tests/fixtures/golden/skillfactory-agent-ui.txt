## Presentation — how a run should look

This skill is watched, not just run. Everything below assumes the user is
reading the conversation, so **the transcript is part of the product.**

**Keep the machinery invisible.** The user should see a short status line and a
table, not a scroll of raw command output. Concretely:

- **Never print file contents into the conversation.** Not a fetched page, not a
  source file, not a script's own source. Scripts hand each other *paths*; when
  you need a file's text in context, use the `Read` tool rather than `cat`,
  `sed`, `head`, or a `--show` flag. Anything the user already has open
  somewhere is a wall of text in chat.
- **One script call, not a pipeline.** Every step should be a single command that
  returns everything you need. If you find yourself chaining `sed`/`grep`/
  `python3 -` to reshape output, the script should have given it to you — say so
  rather than working around it.
- **Report in tables, with named columns.** Ad-hoc prose summaries are why runs
  read inconsistently. Every stage that produces more than one fact reports a
  table with a fixed column set, declared in this skill's own steps below.
  Omit noise: don't list unchanged fields, don't repeat inputs back, don't show
  paths the user can't act on.
- **Show, don't describe.** When a run produces something visual, `Read` the
  rendered image so the user sees it, instead of writing a paragraph about it.
- **Never claim a visual result without the artifact.** "It looks better" with no
  PNG in the transcript is not a result.

**The exception — narrate the slow parts.** Anything that takes more than a
couple of seconds gets one short lowercase line as it starts (`fetching the
posting…`, `rendering press + ats-plain…`) so the user sees progress rather than
dead air. One line each, not a table.

**Announce the skill once, at the start**, in one sentence, and never again.
