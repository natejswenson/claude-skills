# Changelog

All notable changes to `@natjswenson/devlog` are documented here.

## 0.1.9 (2026-06-05) — accessibility fix

**Accessibility**
- The drop-in React component (`examples/react/DevLogPage.jsx`) now exposes the expand/collapse entries as a proper disclosure control. Previously they were mouse-only — a bare `onClick` on `<article>` with no `role`, `tabIndex`, `aria-expanded`, or keyboard handler, so keyboard and screen-reader users could not operate the feed.
  - The header carries `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` for screen-reader toggle semantics.
  - `Enter`/`Space` toggle the focused entry (`preventDefault` on Space stops page scroll).
  - `:focus-visible` outline makes keyboard focus visible.
  - The toggle moved from the whole card to the header, so links inside an expanded entry are no longer nested in an interactive ancestor and text selection in the body works normally.
- Visuals are unchanged: padding/hover/cursor moved from `.devlog-entry` to `.devlog-header`, with the redundant content padding zeroed so spacing matches.

## 0.1.8 (2026-05-01) — final hardening pass

Closes the four Low-Hardening findings from the second adversarial verification:

- **L-1:** `validateConfig` now bounds `projects[].label` length (≤200 chars) and rejects control characters. Label apostrophes/quotes/etc are intentionally allowed since label is React text content only — never shell-interpolated. The validator includes an explicit invariant comment to keep this guarantee load-bearing.
- **L-2:** `atomicWriteJSON` uses `wx` (exclusive create) flag, preventing symlink-attack scenarios on shared filesystems where another local user could pre-create the tmp file.
- **L-3:** `atomicWriteJSON` tmp filename now also includes `Date.now()` for additional uniqueness across rapid sequential calls.
- **L-4:** SKILL.md Step 5 explicitly instructs the LLM to treat fetched dev-log content as data, not instructions — defense against indirect prompt injection from hostile dev-log markdown.

Verification: a second 6-perspective adversarial agent against HEAD reports zero Critical/High/Medium-Active vulnerabilities remain.

## 0.1.7 (2026-05-01) — security hardening + UX improvements

**Security**
- Tightened `SHELL_METACHARS` to additionally reject whitespace, single-quote, square brackets, equals, and percent
- Project paths now cannot start with `-` (would be parsed as flag)
- Added strict validation of the `branch` field (no leading dash, no `..` as a path component)
- Atomic `config.json` writes (write-to-tmp + rename)
- CLI no longer forwards arbitrary `VITE_*` env vars to the spawned vite — only `VITE_DEVLOG_*` plus `PATH`/`HOME`/etc.
- Added `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag to the preview app
- Explicit `urlTransform` in `react-markdown` rejects `data:`, `blob:`, `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, and any non-http(s)/mailto scheme
- `react-markdown` invoked with `skipHtml` for explicit defense-in-depth
- `SKILL.md` instructs the LLM to single-quote every interpolated config value (defense-in-depth on top of validation)
- Production preview builds without env vars show a clear "Setup required" screen instead of attempting demo fetches that would 404
- `config.json` written with mode `0600`, `~/.claude/skills/devlog/` created with mode `0700`
- Pinned all dependencies to exact versions (no `^` ranges) to eliminate resolution drift

**UX**
- `init` now loops to register multiple projects in a single setup
- New `add-project` subcommand: `npx @natjswenson/devlog add-project` — register a project without editing config.json by hand
- New `config` subcommand: `npx @natjswenson/devlog config` — view current config with validation status
- Init detects when `gh` is authenticated as a different user than `githubUser` and warns
- Better next-step messaging after init (color, concrete commands)
- All error messages now include actionable hints (`log.hint`)

**Docs**
- New `SECURITY.md` — threat model, audit history, ruled-out attack scenarios, vulnerability reporting flow
- New `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- README updated with new subcommands and security guarantees section

## 0.1.6 (2026-05-01) — initial security audit fixes

Addressed 1 Critical + 3 High findings from the first round of the 6-agent siege:
- SKILL.md now requires runtime allowlist validation of every config value before shell interpolation
- CLI switched from `execSync` with template strings to `spawnSync` with argv arrays for any user-input-bearing call
- `gh repo create` regex hardened against leading-dash flag injection
- `gitAuthor` validator now rejects shell metachars
- Schema validation added for `manifest.json`, `VITE_DEVLOG_PROJECTS`, frontmatter (allowlist + `Object.create(null)`)
- `optimizeDeps` includes for vite to fix react-markdown / react-dom CJS interop in npx layouts
- Preview vite server bound to localhost only, CORS disabled

## 0.1.5 (2026-05-01)

- Corrected live-site URL in README (`natejswenson.com` not `.io`)

## 0.1.4 (2026-05-01)

- README troubleshooting section, npm + license badges
- SKILL.md uses `<config.branch || 'main'>` consistently in push/URL output

## 0.1.3 (2026-05-01)

- Expanded `optimizeDeps.include` to cover react/react-dom for npx-installed layouts

## 0.1.2 (2026-05-01)

- First `optimizeDeps` fix for `style-to-js` CJS/ESM interop (react-markdown rendering)

## 0.1.1 (2026-05-01)

- `projects[].label` and `branch` config fields (optional, with safe defaults)

## 0.1.0 (2026-05-01)

- Initial release
- CLI: `init`, `preview`
- React drop-in components: `DevLogPage`, `useDevLogEntries`
- Standalone deployable Vite preview app with snarky demo mode
